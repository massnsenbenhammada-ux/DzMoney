# DzMoney — Development Log

This file records implementation milestones and important architectural decisions. Update it after each significant development step.

## 2026-08-19 — Roadmap Baseline

- Added `PROJECT_ROADMAP.md` as the authoritative product/economic specification.
- Agreed to preserve the existing application and avoid destructive rewrites.
- Development must proceed incrementally and safely.

## 2026-08-19 — Phase 1 Economic Foundation Started

- Added `services/economy.js` with isolated economic primitives so the existing Express/wallet/task implementation is not replaced.
- Added `tests/economy.test.js` covering the agreed initial economic rules.
- Initial constants represented in the new module:
  - 1 TON = 10,000 DZX.
  - Minimum deposit = 1 TON.
  - Minimum withdrawal = 0.2 TON.
  - Minimum withdrawal Coins requirement = 2,000,000 Coins.
  - Referral = 20% of base activity reward only.
  - Squad daily activity threshold = 50%.
  - Squad bonus ceiling = 100%.
- Implemented pure functions for TON/DZX conversion, referral calculation, daily Squad activation, Squad bonus resolution, activity reward calculation, economic-budget validation, and withdrawal requirements.
- No existing `server.js`, wallet code, withdrawal code, or frontend code was deleted or rewritten in this step.
